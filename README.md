# Go-based Microcontroller Projects

A place for me to manage all of my projects for the Raspberry Pi Pico, written for the [TinyGo compiler](https://tinygo.org/).

This repo utilizes VS Code and the [TinyGo extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tinygo.vscode-tinygo) ([TinyGo x VS Code docs](https://tinygo.org/docs/guides/ide-integration/vscode/)). It's vital for making it more efficient to write code for TinyGo. It alters `GOOS`, `GOROOT`, `GOARCH`, and `GOFLAGS` to provide linting and intellisense when building.
